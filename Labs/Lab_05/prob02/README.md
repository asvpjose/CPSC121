# Phonebook display
This program loads contact information stored in a text file and displays it on the screen.

The program asks the user to provide the filename of a phonebook file. It will then load all of the names and numbers stored in the file and display them on the screen.

We assume that the file is stored using the correct format wherein for each contact, there is always a name followed by their phone number. Below is an example of a possible phonebook file.

## Sample phonebook file (phonebook.txt):
```
Shanay Wickens
7205972770
Harlee Collins
3328206140
Addison Ryan
7917471622
```

Please see the sample output below assuming it loaded the phonebook file shown above to guide the design of your program. In case there are no contacts, inform the user that there were no contacts stored in the file. If the file does not exist, inform the user that the phonebook file is missing.

## Sample Output:
<pre>
Please provide the file name for your phone book: <b>phonebook.txt</b>

Contact 1:
Name: Shanay Wickens
Number: 7205972770

Contact 2:
Name: Harlee Collins
Number: 3328206140

Contact 3:
Name: Addison Ryan
Number: 7917471622
</pre>

## Empty phonebook sample Output:
<pre>
Please provide the file name for your phone book: <b>phonebook.txt</b>

Phone book does not contain any contacts!
</pre>

## Missing phonebook file sample Output:
<pre>
Please provide the file name for your phone book: <b>phonebookszz.txt</b>

Invalid phonebook file!
</pre>

# Submission checklist
1. Compiled and ran the driver (`main`).
1. Manually checked for compilation and logical errors.
1. Ensured no errors on the unit test (`make test`).
1. Followed advice from the stylechecker (`make stylecheck`).
1. Followed advice from the formatchecker to improve code readbility (`make formatcheck`).

# Code evaluation
Open the terminal and navigate to the folder that contains this exercise. Assuming you have pulled the code inside of `/home/student/labex02-tuffy` and you are currently in `/home/student` you can issue the following commands

```
cd labex02-tuffy
```

You also need to navigate into the problem you want to answer. To access the files needed to answer problem 1, for example, you need to issue the following command.

```
cd prob01
```

When you want to answer another problem, you need to go back up to the parent folder and navigate into the next problem. Assuming you are currently in `prob01`, you can issue the following commands to go to the parent folder then go into another problem you want to answer; `prob02` for example.

```
cd ..
cd prob02
```

Use the `clang++` command to compile your code and the `./` command to run it. The sample code below shows how you would compile code save in `main.cpp` and into the executable file `main`. Make sure you use the correct filenames required in this problem.  Take note that if you make any changes to your code, you will need to compile it first before you see changes when running it.

```
clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main
./main
```

You can run one, two, or all the commands below to `test` your code, `stylecheck` your code's design, or `formatcheck` your work. Kindly make sure that you have compiled and executed your code before issuing any of the commands below to avoid errors.

```
make test
make stylecheck
make formatcheck
```

A faster way of running all these tests uses the `all` parameter.

```
make all
```

# Submission
1. When everything runs correctly,  let's copy your code into the Github repository. The first step is to add your code to what is called the staging area using git's `add` command. The parameter after `add` is the name of the file you want to add. There are cases when you have multiple changed files, so you can just type . (period) to add all modified files.

    ```
    git add main.cpp
    ```
1. Once everything is in the staging area, we use the `commit` command to tell git that we have added everything we need into the staging area.

    ```
    git commit
    ```
1. In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and Github username.

    ```
    git config --global user.email "tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu"
    git config --global user.name "Tuffy Titan"
    ```
    When you're done, make sure you type `git commit` again.    
1. Git will ask you to describe what you have added to the staging area. By default, you will use a command-line based editor called *nano*. Go ahead and provide a description then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> to exit. Press <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm that you want to make changes and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
1. Lets push all changes to the Github repository using git's `push` command. Provide your Github username and password when you are asked.

    ```
    git push
    ```
1. When you finish the exercise, go back to Titanium and click on the `Add submission` button in the lab exercise page. Provide a short message in the text area such as "finished lab exercise" and click on `Save changes`. Finally click on `Submit assignment` to inform your instructor that you are done.

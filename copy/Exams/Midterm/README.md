# Midterm exam Part 2: Programming
## Timing and general instructions
You have **1 hour** to complete the programming part of the midterm exam. This is a closed notes exam so you should not open any website other than the Titanium midterm exam page. Do not communicate with your classmates or look at their screens. Direct all your questions to the instructor or lab assistant only.

You are allowed to view your own study guide and use paper for scratch work that will be provided for you.

You are free to use any editor and the command line on Tuffix to write, compile, and test your program. The instructors will use `clang++` to check your programs so make sure your code works with it.

You are expected to have used the programming environment during our lab sessions so instructors and lab assistants will not answer questions regarding interpretting syntax errors or debugging code.

## Problem and points
There are three programming problems that you need to complete.

1. Discounted sum (*5 points*)
1. Radio (*5 points*) 
1. Student info (*5 points*)

# Submission
Your answers will be submitted through GitHub. You can push your code as many times as you want before the end of the midterm exam. We will check the last version that you pushed.

When you are done, verify you have pushed your code properly on GitHub. Simply refresh your GitHub repo and click on the individual files to see if they have been changed.

On Titanium, click on the `Add submission` button in the midterms page. Provide the URL for your GitHub repo containing the midterm exam and click on `Save changes`. Finally click on `Submit assignment`.

Before leaving the room, please approach the instructor who will verify that you submitted your exam properly. Also turn in your scratch paper and study guide to the instructor.

# Good luck!

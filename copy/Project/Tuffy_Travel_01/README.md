# TuffyTravel Milestone 1

This is milestone 1 of the [TuffyTravel Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1ZAH-vt8ih500WFyDb_j5PO2L3_XS4_3CswPRJ5qNE/edit?usp=sharing).

# Requirements
Create a program that asks the user to input three bus departure times. The system should also ask the user to provide the name of the route to make it easy to distinguish. It should also ask the passenger what time they want to leave. Use conditions to identify the bus route that the passenger should take if they want to leave by the time they specified.

After the user provides the required inputs, the program should display the best route's name, the departure time, and the time they intend to leave. Please see the sample output below to guide the design of your program.

Save your code in the file called `tuffytravel.cpp`.

# Sample output
```
Welcome to TuffyTravel!

Please enter the name of the 1st route: 57x Brea Mall Xpress
Please enter the departure time of the 1st route: 1623

Please enter the name of the 2nd route: 153 Brea Mall
Please enter the departure time of the 2nd route: 1642

Please enter the name of the 3rd route: 57x Brea Mall Xpress
Please enter the departure time of the 3rd route: 1648

Please enter the time you wish to leave: 1630

You should probably take the 153 Brea Mall route that leaves at 1642.
```

# Submission checklist
1. Compiled and ran the driver (`tuffytravel`).
1. Manually checked for compilation and logical errors.
1. Designed and tested your own test cases.
1. Ensured no errors on the unit test (`make test`).
1. Ensured no errors on the style check (`make stylecheck`).
1. Ensured no errors on the format check (`make formatcheck`).
1. Completed reflection file ([reflection.md](reflection.md))

# Code evaluation
Open the terminal and navigate to the folder that contains this exercise. Assuming you have pulled the code inside of `/home/student/ms01-tuffy` and you are currently in `/home/student` you can issue the following commands

```
cd ms01-tuffy
```

Use the `clang++` command to compile your code and the `./` command to run it. The sample code below shows how you would compile code save in `tuffytravel.cpp` and into the executable file `tuffytravel`. Make sure you use the correct filenames required in this problem.  Take note that if you make any changes to your code, you will need to compile it first before you see changes when running it.

```
clang++ -std=c++17 tuffytravel.cpp -o tuffytravel
./tuffytravel
```

You can run one, two, or all the commands below to `test` your code, `stylecheck` your code's design, or `formatcheck` your work. Kindly make sure that you have compiled and executed your code before issuing any of the commands below to avoid errors.

```
make test
make stylecheck
make formatcheck
```

A faster way of running all these tests uses the `all` parameter.

```
make all
```

# Submission
1. When everything runs correctly,  let's copy your code into the Github repository. The first step is to add your code to what is called the staging area using git's `add` command. The parameter after `add` is the name of the file you want to add. There are cases when you have multiple changed files, so you can just type . (period) to add all modified files.

    ```
    git add tuffytravel.cpp
    ```
1. Once everything is in the staging area, we use the `commit` command to tell git that we have added everything we need into the staging area.

    ```
    git commit
    ```
1. In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and Github username.

    ```
    git config --global user.email "tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu"
    git config --global user.name "Tuffy Titan"
    ```
    When you're done, make sure you type `git commit` again.    
1. Git will ask you to describe what you have added to the staging area. By default, you will use a command-line based editor called *nano*. Go ahead and provide a description then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> to exit. Press <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm that you want to make changes and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
1. Lets push all changes to the Github repository using git's `push` command. Provide your Github username and password when you are asked.

    ```
    git push
    ```
1. When you finish the exercise, go back to Titanium and click on the `Add submission` button in the lab exercise page. Provide a short message in the text area such as "finished lab exercise" and click on `Save changes`. Finally click on `Submit assignment` to inform your instructor that you are done.

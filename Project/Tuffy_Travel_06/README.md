# TuffyTravel Milestone 6

This is milestone 6 of the [TuffyTravel Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1ZAH-vt8ih500WFyDb_j5PO2L3_XS4_3CswPRJ5qNE/edit?usp=sharing).

# Requirements
Refactor your code so that it uses object composition. This promotes code reusability and readability. Refactor is a term that refers to restructuring existing code so that it follows a different design but retains the initial codeâ€™s behavior.

Create a `RouteManager` class that will manage your `Route` array. It should still have a capacity of 100 `Route`s. Essentially we are moving all `Route`-array-related functionalities from your `main` function into `RouteManager`. It is up to you to identify the data members you will need inside the class. Make sure to create a default constructor for `RouteManager`.

Create an `add` member function that will add a `Route` object into the `Route` array in `RouteManager`. Take a look at how you implemented this when you added a route from the menu in Milestone 5. Use the following function prototype:

    void add(const Route& route);

The following functions should be moved into `RouteManager`, thereby making them its member functions. As the array is moved into `RouteManager` the functions will no longer need some of the parameters in our previous milestones. It is up to you to figure out where it will get the information. However, make sure you use the following function prototypes so that they work with the unit tests.

    void display_routes();

    void find_route(unsigned short int ttl);

    void save_routes(const std::string& filename);

    void load_routes(const std::string& filename);

Update your `Route` class to provide it with a non default constructor that takes in parameters for name, departure time, and arrival time and assigns it to the corresponding data members. Also create a default constructor that set its name to `"Home"`, departure time to `2000`, and arrival time to `2200`.

There are no changes to the menu. However, your `main` function should now contain a `RouteManager` object that is used to perform the operations when a menu item is selected.

All operations in Milestone 5 should still work in this milestone. Specifically, creating routes, displaying routes, finding routes, saving routes, and loading routes.

As usual, the code should be organized so that class and function prototypes are placed in a header file (`route.hpp`) while their implementations are placed in a source file (`route.cpp`).

Any member functions that contain over five lines of code or use any complex constructs should have their function prototypes in `route.hpp` and their corresponding implementation in `route.cpp`. Finally, the *main* method should be in the driver file (`tuffytravel.cpp`).

Please see the sample output below to guide the design of your program.

# Submission checklist
1. Created classes.
1. Created function prototypes.
1. Created function implementation.
1. Called functions in the driver accordingly.
1. Followed the [proper file structure for using functions](https://github.com/ILXL-guides/function-file-organization)
1. Compiled and ran the driver (`tuffytravel`).
1. Manually checked for compilation and logical errors.
1. Designed and tested your own test cases.
1. Ensured no errors on the unit test (`make test`).
1. Ensured no errors on the style check (`make stylecheck`).
1. Ensured no errors on the format check (`make formatcheck`).
1. Completed reflection file ([reflection.md](reflection.md))

# Code evaluation
Open the terminal and navigate to the folder that contains this exercise. Assuming you have pulled the code inside of `/home/student/ms01-tuffy` and you are currently in `/home/student` you can issue the following commands

```
cd ms01-tuffy
```

Use the `clang++` command to compile your code and the `./` command to run it. The sample code below shows how you would compile code save in `tuffytravel.cpp` and into the executable file `tuffytravel`. Make sure you use the correct filenames required in this problem.  Take note that if you make any changes to your code, you will need to compile it first before you see changes when running it.

```
clang++ -std=c++17 tuffytravel.cpp route.cpp -o tuffytravel
./tuffytravel
```

You can run one, two, or all the commands below to `test` your code, `stylecheck` your code's design, or `formatcheck` your work. Kindly make sure that you have compiled and executed your code before issuing any of the commands below to avoid errors.

```
make test
make stylecheck
make formatcheck
```

A faster way of running all these tests uses the `all` parameter.

```
make all
```

# Submission
1. When everything runs correctly,  let's copy your code into the Github repository. The first step is to add your code to what is called the staging area using git's `add` command. The parameter after `add` is the name of the file you want to add. There are cases when you have multiple changed files, so you can just type . (period) to add all modified files.

    ```
    git add tuffytravel.cpp route.cpp route.hpp
    ```
1. Once everything is in the staging area, we use the `commit` command to tell git that we have added everything we need into the staging area.

    ```
    git commit
    ```
1. In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and Github username.

    ```
    git config --global user.email "tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu"
    git config --global user.name "Tuffy Titan"
    ```
    When you're done, make sure you type `git commit` again.    
1. Git will ask you to describe what you have added to the staging area. By default, you will use a command-line based editor called *nano*. Go ahead and provide a description then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> to exit. Press <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm that you want to make changes and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
1. Lets push all changes to the Github repository using git's `push` command. Provide your Github username and password when you are asked.

    ```
    git push
    ```
1. When you finish the exercise, go back to Titanium and click on the `Add submission` button in the lab exercise page. Provide a short message in the text area such as "finished lab exercise" and click on `Save changes`. Finally click on `Submit assignment` to inform your instructor that you are done.

### save_routes
#### Test case 1: Correctly writing to a file
When the user calls the function and passes the filename, then it should create a file with that filename.

#### Test case 2: Correctly storing a route array with one element
Assuming that the `Route` array passed to the function has one element and a size of one, the first line of the file should be 1 followed by the name, departure time, and arrival time of the `Route` object in the array. The filename should be what is passed as the filename parameter.

#### Test case n: // Descriptive title
// Explanation

### load_routes
#### Test case 1: Loading a file with three routes
Assuming a file with the given filename contains three routes, the function should update the `Route` array so that it contains the three `Route` objects described in the file, and the number of items is changed to 3.
